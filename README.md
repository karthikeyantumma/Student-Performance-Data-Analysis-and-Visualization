# Student-Performance-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

Analyzed and visualized student performance data to uncover patterns and insights related to race/ethnicity and parental education levels. This project involved data filtering, plotting, and database integration, demonstrating a strong understanding of data science techniques and tools.

Key Achievements:

Data visualization: Created comparative visualizations of math, reading, and writing scores against race/ethnicity and parental education levels using different types of charts. This showcased an ability to present data insights effectively through various visualization techniques.
Data Filtering & SQL Integration: Filtered specific data subsets (e.g., female students in group A who completed a test preparation course) and inserted this filtered data into an SQL Server database, highlighting skills in data manipulation and database management.
Python Programming: developed Python scripts that independently performed data analysis tasks, ensuring modularity and reusability across different scenarios.
